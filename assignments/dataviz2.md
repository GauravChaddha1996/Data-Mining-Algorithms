Q.1) Find the Karl Pearson’s coefficient for the vericolors only using the attributes petal length and petal width. What is your observation.
Q.2) How does the petal length of a “large” setosa compare on an average to the petal length of a large virginica? (You can assume large stands for any length greater than or equal to the average value)
Q.3) Draw a q-plot for the sepal length. What is approximately the 75th quantile for the sepal length in the iris data set? (Remember the nth percentile has n% of the values less than or equal to it)
Q.4) Denoise the sepal width attribute using the binning method. The parameter to be used for performing the cleaning is the bin mean. You can use a bin size of three. Plot the histogram of the original data and the cleaned data.
Q.5) Draw a contour map of size 150 x 150 showing the distance between the ijth pair of flowers. The distance is to be computed using the Euclidean metrics. (Hint matplotlib has a contourf method which accepts a matrix)

OPTIONAL
Q.6) Draw a 4 x 4 array of scatter plots where each plot is the scatter plot using the ijth attribute pair for the iris data set. Use different colours to separate the different classes. Plot the histogram of the corresponding attribute on the diagonal of the plot. (Hint matplotlib has a figure and subplot command that could be used in this case. You can add subplots to a figure using the add_subplot command)

1) Visualize the iris data using a scatter plot with a different colour for each class label. Use only the first two columns for the visualization.
2) Find out which two attributes have the highest degree of co relation in the iris data set.
3) Calculate the covariance matrix for the iris data set and observe your findings.
4) Reduce the iris dataset to the first two PCA components and plot the scatter matrix.
5) Write a function to find the entropy of a set of class labels.
6) Use the function created in the last question to find the best split point for the first attribute of the iris dataset.

USE THE IRIS DATASET TO PERFORM THE FOLOWING TASKS

1) Import the data and print the data values, feature names, class labels and class names.
2) Print the average value for each attribute along with their variances.
3) Plot the histogram of the first attribute and the second attribute in the same figure.
4) Plot a boxplot for all the attributes.
5) Scale the first attribute using Min max scaler and z-score scaling.
6) Compute a matrix of distances between individual flowers. (The result is a matrix of dimension 150 x 150)
7) Plot the histogram for all setosa which have sepal length greater than 3.
8) Plot a scatter plot for the first two attributes using different colours for the different types.
9) Find the maximum distance of a flower from the mean position of the distribution.
10) Find the covariance matrix for the first two attributes.
